.SYNOPSIS
    Start a comprehensive developer performance review with automated setup.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the developer review workflow:
    - Creates a dedicated git worktree for the review
    - Sets up directory structure for analysis artifacts
    - Runs data collection scripts (PRs, gaps, bugs)
    - Prepares environment for deep code analysis

    The worktree is created in the 'worktrees' directory which is excluded from git.

.PARAMETER DeveloperName
    The name of the developer to review (used in git log --author)

.PARAMETER StartDate
    Start date for the review period (YYYY-MM-DD format)

.PARAMETER EndDate
    End date for the review period (YYYY-MM-DD format). Defaults to today.

.PARAMETER Branch
    The branch to checkout for review. Defaults to 'dev'.

.PARAMETER MinorPRLines
    Minimum lines changed to consider a PR "major". Defaults to 100.

.PARAMETER MinGapDays
    Minimum days of inactivity to flag as a gap. Defaults to 14.

.PARAMETER SkipDataCollection
    If set, skips automated data collection scripts (useful for re-running analysis)

.EXAMPLE
    .\Start-DeveloperReview.ps1 -DeveloperName "John Doe" -StartDate "2024-01-01" -EndDate "2024-11-01"

    Starts a full review for John Doe covering January through November 2024.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Start-DeveloperReview.ps1 -DeveloperName "Jane Smith" -StartDate "2024-06-01" -Branch "main"

    Reviews Jane Smith's work from June 2024 to now on the main branch.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Start-DeveloperReview.ps1 -DeveloperName "John Doe" -StartDate "2024-01-01" -SkipDataCollection

    Re-opens an existing review without re-running data collection scripts.

## Review Structure

### Data Collection (Automated)
Located in \`data/\` directory:
- **prs.json**: All PRs by the developer
- **major_prs.md**: PRs with significant code changes (>$MinorPRLines lines)
- **activity_gaps.md**: Periods of inactivity (>$MinGapDays days)
- **bug_patterns.md**: Analysis of bugs and fix patterns

### Reports (Manual Analysis)
Located in \`reports/\` directory:
- **detailed_code_quality_analysis.md**: PR-by-PR code review with examples
- **timeline_analysis.md**: Activity patterns and productivity assessment
- **talking_points.md**: Structured discussion guide for review meeting
- **recommendations.md**: Specific, actionable improvements

### Code Reviews (Deep Dives)
Located in \`code_reviews/\` directory:
- Individual PR diffs and analysis for major PRs

## Review Workflow

1. ✅ **Data Collection Complete** - Automated scripts have run
2. ⏳ **Review Data** - Examine automated reports in data/
3. ⏳ **Deep Code Analysis** - Review major PRs using Get-PRDiff.ps1
4. ⏳ **Document Findings** - Fill in reports/ templates
5. ⏳ **User Validation** - Present findings and gather feedback (CRITICAL)
6. ⏳ **Finalize Assessment** - Integrate user feedback into final review

## Commands

### Get PR diff for detailed review:
\`\`\`powershell
cd $ScriptDir
.\Get-PRDiff.ps1 -PRNumber <NUMBER> -OutputPath "$analysisPath\code_reviews\pr_<NUMBER>.diff"
\`\`\`

### Re-run data collection:
\`\`\`powershell
cd $ScriptDir
.\Start-DeveloperReview.ps1 ``
    -DeveloperName "$DeveloperName" ``
    -StartDate "$StartDate" ``
    -EndDate "$EndDate" ``
    -Branch "$Branch"
\`\`\`

### Clean up when done:
\`\`\`powershell
cd $RepoRoot
git worktree remove $worktreePath
\`\`\`

## Important Reminders

- **Always validate findings with user via ask_human before finalizing**
- Use specific code examples, not vague observations
- Consider context (OnCall, blockers, project complexity)
- Balance positive feedback with constructive criticism
- Focus on root causes, not just symptoms
